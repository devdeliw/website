Hi, 

This site stores notes I make about code or math. 

I am an astrophysics and applied math major at uc berkeley. 
I like programming in Rust and writing fast code. 

I did some simulation work at NASA Glenn research center. 
I also worked a bit with JWST photometry studying the Galactic Center. 

Most recently, I wrote a native memory-safe Rust BLAS (basic linear algebra subprograms)
called [CORAL](https://github.com/devdeliw/coral/tree/main). It reaches performance 
"competitive" with OpenBLAS.
