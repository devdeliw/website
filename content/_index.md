Hi, 

This is where I store notes I make about code and math. 

I am an astrophysics and applied math major at uc berkeley 
and enjoy programming in rust and writing fast code. 

I have done some simulation work at NASA Glenn Research Center,
and worked with JWST photometry studying the Galactic Center.

Most recently, I wrote a native memory-safe Rust BLAS (basic linear algebra subprograms)
called [CORAL](https://github.com/devdeliw/coral/tree/main). It reaches performance 
"competitive" with OpenBLAS.
