This post is math heavy. I'll try to walk through it all elegantly though. The
important equations are boxed if you'd like to skip through. On mobile some
equations may go overfull.

In [Part 1](https://dev-undergrad.dev/posts/nasa_derive_1/) we derived the
Zeeman Hamiltonian and the Hyperfine Hamiltonian. The goal of this post is to provide
a concise derivation of the next two Hamiltonian terms for [Zero-Field
Splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-field_splitting)
and the [Exchange Interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_interaction
). Finally, a complete Spin Hamiltonian description is given. 

I use a fancy $\mathscr{H}$ to represent the full Spin Hamiltonian.
Sub-Hamiltonians are normal $H$'s but with hats (e.g. $\hat{H}_Z$).

## Zero-Field Splitting

We start immediately from Equation (6) in Part 1:

$$
\begin{align}
\vec{B}(\vec{r}) = \underbrace{\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ 3(\vec{\mu}_n \cdot \hat{r})
\hat{r} - \vec{\mu}_n \right]}\_{\text{dipolar term}} + \underbrace{\frac{2\mu_0}{3}\vec{\mu}_n \delta^3 (\vec{r})}\_{\text{contact (isotropic) term}}.
\end{align} 
$$
