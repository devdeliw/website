I started CORAL as a project to learn both at the same time.\nCORAL stands for COre Rust Architecture for Linear algebra. It is an implementation of the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms, or BLAS in pure Rust, but only for AArch64 architectures right now.\nBLAS is the set of the most common low-level operations, \u0026ldquo;kernels\u0026rdquo; for linear algebra. These kernels naturally form three levels:\nLevel 1# Vector-Vector Operations Think of things like calculating the dot product, $\\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{y}$, or multiplying a vector by a scalar $\\alpha \\vec{x}$.
